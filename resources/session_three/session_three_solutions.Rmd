As always, we start by loading the tidyverse package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Back to the Basics

### R for statistics

#### Part 1

```{r}
x <- mpg$displ
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
mean(x)
```

```{r}
median(x)
```

#### Part 3

`range()` gives us both the minimum and maximum in a vector of length two.

```{r}
range(x)
```

Or we can use `min()` and `max()` to get each of these independently.

```{r}
min(x)
```

```{r}
max(x)
```

#### Part 4

The lower and upper quartile can be found using

```{r}
quantile(x)[1]
```

```{r}
quantile(x)[4]
```

For the interquartile range we can either subtract the larger of these from the smaller or use `IQR()` directly.

```{r}
IQR(x)
```

#### Part 5

```{r}
var(x)
```

```{r}
sd(x)
```

As expected, we have.

```{r}
near(var(x), sd(x) ^ 2)
```

### Missing Values

#### Part 1

`NA` represents a missing/unknown value. If we add 5 to an unknown value then we don't know what the result we be. Hence `5 + NA` returns `NA`.

```{r}
5 + NA
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
all(is.na(c(
  5 + NA,
  5 - NA,
  5 * NA,
  5 / NA,
  5 ^ NA
)))
```

This rule follows for all of the standard arithmetic operators. In fact, (pretty much) every operator will have this behaviour.

#### Part 3

```{r}
median(c(2, 6, 3, 4, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Part 4

We know that any real number (except zero, which we ignore) to the power of zero is one. It therefore doesn't matter what the original `NA` was in almost every circumstance. Hence `NA ^ 0` returns `1`

```{r}
NA ^ 0
```

Using similar logic we get that `NA | TRUE` returns `TRUE` and `NA & FALSE` returns `FALSE`.

The general rule is that whenever we apply an operator to a missing value that would always return the same value if known, the result is the same as what would normally be returned.

### Arithmetic with Boolean Values

#### Part 1

```{r}
5 + TRUE
```

Under-the-hood, `TRUE` is stored as `1`, and so when we use `TRUE` in an arithmetic operation, it gets converted to this numeric form.

#### Part 2

Likewise `FALSE` is stored as `0` so `5 + FALSE` is `5`.

#### Part 3

Since `TRUE` represents `1` and `FALSE` represents `0`, the sum of a logical vector will return the number of `TRUE` values.

#### Part 4

Similar to before, but `mean()` will give the proportion of true values.

#### Part 5

`FALSE < TRUE` is the same as `0 < 1` which is clearly true. This means that `FALSE` values will be sorted before `TRUE` values by default when we use `arrange()`.

### Comparisons and Boolean Operators

#### Part 1

Replacing the comparisons with their logical values we get `(TRUE & FALSE) | TRUE`. `TRUE & FALSE` becomes `FALSE` leaving us with `FALSE | TRUE` which is TRUE.

#### Part 2

Due to floating point errors, it is not the case that `sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2` though it is true that `near(sqrt(2) ^ 2, 2)`. This therefore evaluates to `FALSE | !TRUE` which is `FALSE | FALSE`, which finally becomes `FALSE`.

#### Part 3

Looking at `?Syntax`, we see that the order of operations for Boolean operators is `!` then `&`, then `|`. 

We therefore first evaluate `!FALSE` to get `TRUE`. Then we look at `FALSE & TRUE` to get `FALSE`. Lastly we have `FALSE | TRUE` which is `TRUE`. Note that if we had evaluated `|` before `&`, we have obtained the opposite result.

## The dpylr verbs

### Filter

#### Part 1

We can use the `filter()` verb to extract all automatic cars by Audi and read the number of observations from the top of the printed out tibble. Alternatively, we can wrap the output in `nrow()`

```{r}
nrow(filter(mpg, trans == 'auto(l5)', manufacturer == 'audi'))
```

There are 5 such cars.

#### Part 2

```{r}
filter(mpg, hwy > 41)
```

These two cars are by Volkswagen.

#### Part 3

```{r}
filter(iris, Petal.Width > Petal.Length)
```

We are returned an empty tibble so there are not any plants in the dataset with this property.

#### Part 4

```{r}
filter(diamonds, price == max(price))
```

The highest price is $18,823 (currency obtained from `?diamonds`) and the carat of this diamond is 2.29.

#### Part 5

```{r}
mpg_grpd <- group_by(mpg, year)
filter(mpg_grpd, displ == min(displ))
```

There are actually multiple cars sharing the minimum engine size for each year although they are all of the same make and model.

Note that we could have used a pipe (`%>%`) instead of creating `mpg_grpd`.

#### Part 6

```{r}
filter(iris, Petal.Length > 6.4 | Petal.Width > 2.4)
```

### Arrange

#### Part 1

If we arrange by city milage in descending order, then the top line in the dataset will contain the car with the best city mileage.

```{r}
arrange(mpg, desc(cty))
```

This is a Volkswagen Beetle. If we wanted the worst, we would simply omit `desc()`.

#### Part 2

```{r}
arrange(iris, Petal.Length * Petal.Width)
```

#### Part 3

We actually don't need to print the tables. The function `glimpse()` will give us these types.

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
```

`class` is a character variable and so this column will be ordered alphabetically. Meanwhile, `cut` is an ordinal (ordered) variable and so will be ordered in the same way as the undersying order assigned to the column.

#### Part 4

```{r}
arrange(mpg, hwy - cty)
```

### Select

#### Part 1

```{r}
select(iris, Species, everything())
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
rename(mpg, eng_size = displ)
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
select(diamonds, -price)
```

#### Part 4

Select the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 11th column of the `mpg` dataset.

### Mutate

#### Part 1

```{r}
mutate(mpg, cty_km_l = cty * 1.6 / 3.8)
```

Remember that this new column will be added at the end.

#### Part 2

```{r}
mutate(diamonds, max_dimension = max(x, y, z))
```

#### Part 3

N/A

#### Part 4

```{r}
mutate(mpg, trans = factor(trans))
```

#### Part 5

```{r}
mutate(mpg, is_automatic = trans == 'auto(l5)')
```

#### Part 6

```{r}
mpg_grpd <- group_by(mpg, class)
mutate(mpg_grpd, best_in_class = hwy == max(hwy))
```

#### Part 7

```{r}
mutate(diamonds, expensive = price > quantile(price)[3])
```

### Summarise

#### Part 1

```{r}
summarise(mpg, cty_var = var(cty), hwy_var = var(hwy))
```

#### Part 2

I will start using the pipe operator from this point onwards.

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
summarise(iris,
          Petal.Length.Median = median(Petal.Length),
          Petal.Width.Median = median(Petal.Width),
          Sepal.Length.Median = median(Sepal.Length),
          Sepal.Width.Median = median(Sepal.Width))
```

There is actually an easier way to do this using `summarise_at()` though this set of functions can be quite difficult to get your head around.

#### Part 4

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(min(price))
```

#### Part 5

```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(MeanOzone = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Part 6

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut, color) %>%
  summarise(range = diff(range(carat)))
```

### Pipelines

#### Part 1

```{r}
mpg %>%
  filter(class != '2-seater') %>%
  mutate(efficiency = (cty + hwy) / 2) %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(max_efficiency = max(efficiency)) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_efficiency))
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(Petal.Area = Petal.Width * Petal.Length,
         Sepal.Area = Sepal.Width * Sepal.Length) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Petal.Area, y = Sepal.Area, col = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

#### Part 3

N/A

## Going Beyond

### Ranking

#### Part 1

Done.

#### Part 2

A dense rank makes the most sense here since we want to select all days with the second highest for each month.

```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  # low values have low rank so negate total_rainfall
  mutate(solar_rank = dense_rank(-Solar.R)) %>%
  filter(solar_rank == 2) %>%
  # optionally remove ranking column
  select(-solar_rank)
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
mpg %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(mileage_rank = dense_rank(cty)) %>%
  filter(mileage_rank == 1) %>%
  # we no longer need the rank column
  select(-mileage_rank)
```

### Un-grouping

#### Part 1

We recieve the error ``Error: Column `Class` can't be modified because it's a grouping variable``.

#### Part 2

The error occurs when we run the `mutate` function.

#### Part 3

The problem is that we didn't ungroup before applying the mutate. We are therefore still grouped by `Class` and `Age` which means that we are not allowed to modify either of these until we have ungrouped.
